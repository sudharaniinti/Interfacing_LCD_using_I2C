# Interfacing_LCD_using_I2C
- an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) setup using I2C with three different microcontroller boards: the NodeMCU, STM32F401RE, and the classic Arduino UNO!

I am pleased to present what I have been working on today - an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) setup using I2C with three different microcontroller boards. It was pure curiosity leading the way, pushing me to connect an LCD to three different microcontrollers - the NodeMCU, STM32F401RE, and the classic Arduino UNO!

While the end result wasn't groundbreaking, the journey itself fueled my passion and reminded me of the magic in seeking new knowledge. Sometimes, the best creations come from the simple pursuit of what makes you excited.
